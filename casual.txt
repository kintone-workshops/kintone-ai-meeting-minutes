Hey, Will. Have any plans for the weekend?

[Will] 14:25:30
I'm planning to go to the beach with my family on Saturday.

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:25:33
Oh, that sounds great. Don't forget your sunscreen.

[Will] 14:25:38
How about you?

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:25:40
I'm having a barbecue this Sunday. Going to grill some hot dogs. Would you like to come?

[Will] 14:25:47
We will be delighted to, but I think we will be quite tired out after our trip. Please invite us again next time.

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:25:55
Okay, will do.
