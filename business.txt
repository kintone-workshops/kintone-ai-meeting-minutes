Hello Will, could you please check over the latest customer data?

[Will] 14:19:06
Okay, it looks like we have 3 deals that we can close soon.

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:19:12
Oh, that's great. Please talk with Sarah for marketing to get the latest information.

[Will] 14:19:18
Should I prioritize this task over the application for the conference?

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:19:23
Oh, you're right. Sorry. For now, please focus on the application for the conference first.

[Sean / ショーン＠Kintone Tokyo] 14:19:29
It is very important to our mission. I will ask Joe from sales to check over the 3 deals instead.

[Will] 14:19:35
Thanks, Sean.
